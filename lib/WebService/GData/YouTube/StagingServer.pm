=head1 DESCRIPTION

!DEVELOPER RELEASE! API may change, program may break or be under optimized.


This package is just a flag that forces all the youtube related packages to use the staging server urls
instead of the live server.

You must use it before *any* YouTube::* related packages. Most of the time, the above SYNOPSYS will be all you have to do.

You should use this module on your own staging server (never on the live one!) to see 
if an upcoming API modifications could break your program.
